          <button class="btn-info"  id="d1"><span>JavaScript (JS)</span></button>
          <blockquote class="blockquotes">
            <p>an object-oriented computer programming language commonly used to create interactive effects within web browsers.</p>

          <button class="btn-info"  id="d2"><span>Operators</span></button>
          <blockquote class="blockquotes">
            <p>Operators in JavaScript are very similar to operators that appear in other programming languages. The definition of an operator is a symbol that is used to perform an operation. Most often these operations are arithmetic (addition, subtraction, etc), but not always.</p>

        <li>
          <button class="btn-info" id="d3"><span>Variables</span></button>
          <blockquote class="blockquotes">
            <p>Variables can be thought of as named containers. You can place data into these containers and then refer to the data simply by naming the container. Before you use a variable in a JavaScript program, you must declare it. Variables are declared with the var keyword as follows.</p>
          </blockquote>
        </li>
        <li>
          <button class="btn-info" id="d4"><span>Variable naming conventions</span></button>
          <blockquote class="blockquotes">
            <p>In computer programming, a naming convention is a set of rules for choosing the character sequence to be used for identifiers which denote variables, types, functions, and other entities in source code and documentation.</p>

        <li>
          <button class="btn-info" id="d5"><span>Functions</span></button>
          <blockquote class="blockquotes">
            <p>The function statement declares a function. A declared function is "saved for later use", and will be executed later, when it is invoked (called). In JavaScript, functions are objects, and they have both properties and methods. A function can also be defined using an expression (See Function Definitions).</p>

          <blockquote class="blockquotes">
            <p>JavaScript functions have a built-in object called the arguments object. The argument object contains an array of the arguments used when the function was called (invoked).</p>

        </li>
        <li>
          <button class="btn-info" id="d8"><span>Parameters</span></button>
          <blockquote class="blockquotes">
            <p>Function parameters are the names listed in the function definition.</p>

        </li>
        <li>
          <button class="btn-info" id="d9"><span>Return</span></button>
          <blockquote class="blockquotes">
            <p> The return statement stops the execution of a function and returns a value from that function.</p>
          </blockquote>
        </li>
        <li>
          <button class="btn-info" id="d10"><span>Chaining methods</span></button>
          <blockquote class="blockquotes">
            <p>Chaining Methods, also known as Cascading, refers to repeatedly calling one method after another on an object, in one continuous line of code. This technique abounds in jQuery and other JavaScript libraries and it is even common in some JavaScript native methods.</p>

        </li>
        <li>
          <button class="btn-info" id="d11"><span>Strings</span></button>
          <blockquote class="blockquotes">
            <p>A JavaScript string stores a series of characters like "John Doe". A string can be any text inside double or single quotes: var carname = "Volvo XC60"; var carname = 'Volvo XC60'; String indexes are zero-based: The first character is in position 0, the second in 1, and so on.</p>
          </blockquote>
        </li>
        <li>
          <button class="btn-info" id="d12"><span>Booleans</span></button>
          <blockquote class="blockquotes">
            <p>The Boolean object represents two values, either "true" or "false". If value parameter is omitted or is 0, -0, null, false, NaN, undefined, or the empty string (""), the object has an initial value of false.</p>

        </li>
        <li>
          <button class="btn-info" id="d13"><span>Undefined</span></button>
          <blockquote class="blockquotes">
            <p>In JavaScript, undefined means a variable has been declared but has not yet been assigned a value, such as: var TestVar; alert(TestVar); //shows undefined alert(typeof TestVar); //shows undefined. null is an assignment value.</p>
          </blockquote>
        </li>
        <li>
          <button class="btn-info" id="d14"><span>NaN</span></button>
          <blockquote class="blockquotes">
            <p>The isNaN() function determines whether a value is an illegal number (Not-a-Number). This function returns true if the value equates to NaN. Otherwise it returns false.</p>
          </blockquote>
        </li>
        <li>
          <button class="btn-info" id="d15"><span>Escape</span></button>
          <blockquote class="blockquotes">
            <p>The escape() function was deprecated in JavaScript version 1.5. Use encodeURI() or encodeURIComponent() instead. The escape() function encodes a string. This function makes a string portable, so it can be transmitted across any network to any computer that supports ASCII characters.</p>

        </li>
        <li>
          <button class="btn-info" id="d16"><span>Alert</span></button>
          <blockquote class="blockquotes">
            <p>The alert() method displays an alert box with a specified message and an OK button. An alert box is often used if you want to make sure information comes through to the user.</p>

        </li>
        <li>
          <button class="btn-info" id="d17"><span>Comments</span></button>
          <blockquote class="blockquotes">
            <p>JavaScript comments can be used to explain JavaScript code, and to make it more readable. JavaScript comments can also be used to prevent execution, when testing alternative code.</p>

        </li>
        <li>
          <button class="btn-info" id="d18"><span>jQuery</span></button>
          <blockquote class="blockquotes">
            <p>jQuery is a cross-platform JavaScript library designed to simplify the client-side scripting of HTML. ... jQuery's syntax is designed to make it easier to navigate a document, select DOM elements, create animations, handle events, and develop Ajax applications.</p>

        </li>
        <li>
          <button class="btn-info" id="d19"><span>Attributes</span></button>
          <blockquote class="blockquotes">
            <p>All properties have a name. In addition they also have a value.The value is one of the property's attributes.Other attributes are: enumerable, configurable, and writable.These attributes define how the property can be accessed (is it readable?, is it writable?)In JavaScript, all attributes can be read, but only the value attribute can be changed (and only if the property is writable).</p>
